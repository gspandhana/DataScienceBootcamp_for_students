# Data Science Workshop We Hub - MathWorks 
## COHORT 1 Case Studies

This repository was developed as part of the Data Science Workshop jointly organised by WE Hub and MathWorks to disseminate knowledge among school children on the  application of data science in varied sectors including but not limited to Healthcare, Climate Change, Human Rights, Agriculture and Food Security.

The aim of these case studies is to facilitate the participants in getting hands-on experience in applying data science tools and techniques for solving real-world problems. Each of the case study will include curated datasets and clear problem statements so that the students can focus on the data science learnings and less on the data collection and understanding.

**Data Science Lifecycle** 
The CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a process model with six phases that naturally describes the data science life cycle.
