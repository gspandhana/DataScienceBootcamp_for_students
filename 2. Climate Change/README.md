# CLIMATE CHANGE CASE STUDY

[Globally nine out of 10 people breathe air that exceeds guideline limits by the World Health Organization (WHO). Air pollution has been linked to infant deaths, and this month a landmark inquest in the UK allowed it to be listed as a cause of a nine-year-old girlâ€™s death in her medical death certificate.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dishashetty/2020/12/22/air-pollution-cost-india-368-billion-in-2019/?sh=47e8c4355c70)

[A report published by the Lancet says pollution in India has led to an increase in diseases such as lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, neonatal disorders and respiratory diseases, resulting in millions more deaths. The data shows that pollution-related deaths in India are on the rise, increasing from 1.24m in 2017 to 1.67m in 2019.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dishashetty/2020/12/22/air-pollution-cost-india-368-billion-in-2019/?sh=47e8c4355c70)

The dataset contains air quality data and AQI (Air Quality Index) at hourly and daily level of various stations across multiple cities in India. The following cities are covered - Ahmedabad, Aizawl, Amaravati, Amritsar, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Brajrajnagar, Chandigarh, Chennai, Coimbatore, Delhi, Ernakulam, Gurugram, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Jorapokhar, Kochi, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Patna, Shillong, Talcher, Thiruvananthapuram, Visakhapatnam.

"The data has been made publicly available by the Central Pollution Control Board: https://cpcb.nic.in/ which is the official portal of Government of India. They also have a real-time monitoring app: https://app.cpcbccr.com/AQI_India/"

## POTENTIAL QUESTIONS TO EXPLORE

* Which are the cities that have seen huge changes in pollution levels and why? (time series)
* Which are the Pollution hotspots in India and have they changed over time? (Spatial and Temporal)
* Has COVID-19 impacted the air pollution in certain cities and by how much?
